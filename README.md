# Is Brazil going to win?

This website was made utilizing Azmine Toushik Wasi database that lists all Brazil football matches since 1914.
It's a simple project made mainly to test some of my recently learned django and css skills.
To put it simply, the program filters from the database the matches that contains the user input, then it divides the numbers of won matches by the total of matches.
